## Q2 2020-2024
Turned my focus to the corporate grind, still there but but reclaiming the moonlight. Several projects started but nothing released. Spent my nights becoming a better `Software Engineer` > `Senior Software Engineer` > `Software Engineering Manager` for a fortune 100.

## Q1 2020
I launched [gregoryedgerton.com](http://gregoryedgerton.com) a few weeks before COVID-19 lockdowns began in Q1 of 2020 after nearly 2 decades of entrepreneurialism. Suddenly self-promotion became a lot less important. Made an edit it 2021 to the bio, thats about it. I think its a good relfection of the decade that proceeded it.

## 2001-2019
18yrs of passion on the other side editing, desiging, and coding expressed as an array of strings in reverse chronological order.
