I launched [gregoryedgerton.com](http://gregoryedgerton.com) a few weeks before COVID-19 lockdowns began. Suddenly self promotion became a lot less important. I'm still proud of it, but it's gone bit stale. Bio kinda cringy in retrospect but it's still from the heart so I won't run from it. That's me. I have so much more to show but that will be for another time. New site brewin'
