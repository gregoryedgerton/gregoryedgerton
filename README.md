I launched [gregoryedgerton.com](http://gregoryedgerton.com) a few weeks before COVID-19 lockdowns began in Q1 of 2020. Suddenly self-promotion became a lot less important. I'm still proud of it, but it's will be retired this year in favor of new passions.

## 2025 Projects
- **[Golden Grids](https://github.com/gregoryedgerton/golden-grids)**: an open-source library for generating grids that challenge the status quo
- **No Regerts**: a [Bitcoin Ordinal](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals/) project
- **Project Guilt**: an [Etherum NFT](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) project

## 2020-2024
Spent too much time give my soul to the corporate grid and not enough time feeding balancing my passions. Several projects started but nothing released. Spent my nights becoming a better `Software Engineer` > `Senior Software Engineer` > `Software Engineering Manager` for a fortune 100.
